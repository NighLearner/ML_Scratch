# ML_Scratch: Machine Learning from the Ground Up

An educational open-source project focused on implementing machine learning models and algorithms from scratch, inspired by libraries like scikit-learn.

## About the Project

Building models from the ground up is the best way to understand how machine learning works. This repository offers a collection of Python implementations, emphasizing clarity and educational value.

The aim is to demystify machine learning and provide a hands-on resource for learners, educators, and developers. Planned coverage includes:

- **Linear Models:** Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
- **Logistic Models:** Logistic Regression
- **Tree-Based Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forests
- **Clustering:** K-Means, DBSCAN
- *...and more!*

This project is intended as a learning tool, not a replacement for established libraries.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ML_Scratch.git
```
*(Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username.)*

Explore the folders and run the Python scripts to see each model's implementation.
